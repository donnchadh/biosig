Introduction:
---------------

The aim of this repository is providing a C/C++ software library for biomedical signal processing. 
This library is called "BioSig for C/C++" and is complementary to "BioSig for Octave and Matlab". 

BioSig4C++ provides several tools:  
(1) "libbiosig.a" provides a library for accessing different dataformats. 
Recommended: zlib (http://zlib.net/) and GNU Scientific Library (GSL)
The supported data formats are listed here: 
http://hci.tugraz.at/schloegl/biosig/TESTED
(2) "save2gdf" is a converter between different file formats, 
including but not limited to SCP-ECG(EN1064), HL7aECG (FDA-XML), GDF, EDF, BDF, CWFB.
    save2gdf can be also used to upload or retrieve data from a bscs server. 
(3) "mexSLOAD" is a MEX-interface for Octave and Matlab
Requirement: Matlab OR Octave (v2.9 or higher) with octave-headers
For Matlab, precompiled binaries are available in matlab/mexSLOAD.mex*    
(4) "_biosig.so" is an interface to python. 
Requirement: python, python-dev, python-scipy, swig (http://www.swig.org/)
(5) SigViewer 
Requirement: qmake, Qt4
(6) Precompiled binaries for Win32
   win32/save2gdf.exe  binary converter
   win32/libbiosig.a   library for MinGW 4.x (might work with other compilers too) 


The internal data structure resemble the header structure similar to
  http://biosig.cvs.sourceforge.net/biosig/biosig/doc/header.txt
and is defined in
  http://biosig.cvs.sourceforge.net/biosig/biosig4c++/biosig.h
(see HDRTYPE and CHANNEL_TYPE)

Encoding of Event/Markers/Annotations is available here: 
  http://hci.tugraz.at/schloegl/matlab/eeg/EventCodes.html

The latest list of supported data formats is available here:

Compilation: 
-------------
# Linux 
You need g++(>4.0), make and zlib. (If you do not have zlib, do not define WITH_ZLIB).
Running make compiles the converter.
  make 		 	# makes the file format converter
  make save2gdf 	# makes the file format converter
  make win32		# makes the file format converter for Win32
  make physicalunits 	# makes the en/decoder for physical units
  make libbiosig.a  	# makes a static library 
  make mex4o 		# makes mexSLOAD for Octave (requires Octave-headers2.9 or higher)
  make mex4m 		# makes mexSLOAD for Matlab (path_to_mex need to be defined in Makefile)
  make sigviewer 	# recompiles SigViewer	(requires qmake and Qt, and the sources of sigviewer must be in ../sigviewer)
  make biosig4python 	# compiles the BioSig interface for Python (requires SWIG and Python)
  make all  		# all of the above
  make testscp 
  make testhl7	
  make test		# tests HL7<->SCP, SCP<->GDF, GDF<->HL7 converters
  make test6		# tests bidirectional conversion between 6 differerent data formats	

# MinGW Crosscompiler on Linux for Windows  
Currently, only the file converter save2gdf is supported.
- install mingw32 mingw32-binutils mingw32-runtime
- run the command  
   make win32

# Windows + MinGW
Currently, only the file converter save2gdf is supported.
- You need MinGW with g++ and make.
- run the make command 
   make -f Makefile.win32

# Windows + MinGW + Matlab
do the steps in "Windows+MinGW"
install and configure gnumex (from http://gnumex.sf.net)  
  make mex
	
# Windows + Cygwin
Currently, only the file converter save2gdf is supported.
- install Cygwin
- within Cygwin install g++, zlib, and make 
- run the make command 
   make save2gdf 

# Other platforms (Windows+MSVC, MacOSX, Solaris, etc. )
Not tested (yet). Let me know about successful compilations, 
or tell me what changes are needed.   

	
Installation: 
-------------
run as root 
  make 
  make install 		# installs save2gdf, save2scp, save2aecg, 
  make install_octave	# installs mexSLOAD.mex in /usr/local/share/octave/site-m/
  make install_sigviewer	# installs sigviewer
 


Execution:
----------
# if test.gdf exists, some header information is displayed
save2gdf test.gdf     		

# help and usage information 
save2gdf -h

# converts a data file into a GDF format (destination
save2gdf PFE103.scp t5.gdf     		

# converts a data file into a SCP format (destination
save2scp t5.gdf t5.scp      		
save2gdf -f=SCP t5.gdf t5.scp      		

# converts a data file into a HL7aECG format (destination
save2aecg t5.gdf t5.hl7      		
save2gdf -f=HL7aECG t5.gdf t5.hl7

# load matlab into octave or matlab
start octave or matlab
addpath path_to_mexSLOAD.mex
[data,HDR] = mexSLOAD(filename); % loads data and header information 


Open Issue(s) of the SCP-ECG <-> HL7aECG converter:
---------------------------------------------------
The following fields of SCP-ECG are not converted to HL7. 
= Mandatory fields (prEN1064:2007 p.18, chp 5.4.3.1) not propagated to HL7:  
- time zone information, (tag34, section 1)
- "ID of acquiring device" (tag14, section 1)
= "Highly recommended" fields (prEN1064:2007 p.18, chp 5.4.3.1) not propagated to HL7:  
- "ID of analysing device", Patient first name, 
= Other fields of the SCP-ECG standard, 
- section 1: blood pressure, medication, etc
- section 4 (QRS location), 7 (global measurements), 8-11 (interpretative statements)
The following fields of HL7aECG are not converted to SCP-ECG.
- study, treatment group, clinical trial, clinical trial protocol, trial sponsor, investigator etc. 


Development & Testing:
----------------------
There are several testing functions included. 
The following commands test the converter and should finish without errors.  
	make test 
	make testhl7
	make testscp
	make test6

The Octave/Matlab script 
	test0/test01.m 
tests whether the various data formats give the same results 
or whether some conversion error has been included.
